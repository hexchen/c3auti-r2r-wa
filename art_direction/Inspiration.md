This is just a gorgeous recource Pack for minecraft and I absolutely love it for it's gorgeous color, great use of style, general cuteness and minimalism.

### Hyper light drifter

Ori and the blind forest is also a great exploration of a mystical, magical stilized forest.

### Hilda
It's just ... aaaaaah so cute and wholesome and has great cozy wooden interiours.
